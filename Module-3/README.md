# CSIT-165

In Module 3 exercise #17 you will change the block-quote below:

Could it be another line???
This is crazy!  What does it all mean?

`This is a line you will change!`

1) Croque monsieur with bacon
2) Chile relleno with rice and green salsa
3) Santa Fe trail mix
4) Slices of meatloaf and mashed potatoes from Baron's
5) Steamed vegetables

There is nothing better than enjoying your mother-in-law's chile relleno.  It was delicious.
And now I am trying to add a new line

And this is another new line.  Let's see how the merge goes.
